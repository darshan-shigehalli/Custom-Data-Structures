# Custom Data Structures

Custom Data Structures is a comprehensive project designed to implement and explore the functionalities of fundamental data structures in Java. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with common data structures, enhance problem-solving skills, and demonstrate their core operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Key Features

- **Data Structure Implementations:** Core operations of **7 key data structures** implemented in Java, including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Binary Search Trees, and Heaps.
- **Logging Integration:** Utilizes **Logback** for efficient application logging to monitor and debug the code execution.
- **Maven Build Tool:** Uses **Maven** for managing dependencies and automating project builds.
- **Executable JAR File:** The project is packaged into an executable JAR file for easy execution and testing.
- **Unit Testing:** Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implemented data structures.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages industry-standard tools and frameworks to ensure high quality, maintainability, and ease of use:

- **Java:** Core programming language for implementing data structures.
- **Maven:** For build automation and dependency management.
- **Logback:** Advanced logging framework to track and debug application flow.
- **JUnit:** For testing the correctness of data structures and operations.

## Libraries and Utilities

The project uses several libraries to enhance functionality and ensure extensibility:

- **Jackson:** For JSON serialization and deserialization (if applicable in the project).
- **Logback:** Used for creating logs to track application behavior and operations.

## Summary

Custom Data Structures is an educational project built to explore and deepen understanding of essential data structures. By implementing various structures in Java and utilizing modern tools like Maven and Logback, this project serves as an excellent resource for anyone looking to master data structures and their real-world applications.
